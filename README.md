In order to be able to play a game with Sheldon, you need to install Python on your local machine or use node.
For python API you need to install flask, flask_cors and requests.
After that you need to navigate to pythonApi folder and run python uiService.py and python gameService.py.

Other option is to navigate to nodeApi folder and just do npm install and npm start.
